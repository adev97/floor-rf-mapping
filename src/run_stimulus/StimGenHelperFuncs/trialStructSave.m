%           Meta, a struct capturing rig/session/git info for this run
%                 (e.g. monitorInfo, mouseID, experimenter, tag, git
%                 commit hash) -- saved alongside trials so "what
%                 produced this data?" is always answerable from the
%                 .mat file itself
%           Savename, stimulus name
%           tag, mouse id
%           iftest, appends '_test' to filename if == 1

%           Note: user must supply a tag number. The visual stimulation PC
%           has no access to this number. There is a builtin check in this
%           function to ensure the user does not overwrite pre-existing
%           trialstruct files
